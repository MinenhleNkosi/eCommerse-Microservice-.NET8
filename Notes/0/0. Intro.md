# About the app ©️
I am building an **eCommerce** application using **microservices architecture**, incorporating an **API gateway** for `centralized access`, **role-based authentication** for `secure user management`, and **caching** for `improved performance`.

## Asynchronous Programming ⚡⚡
For this application I will use `async` programming. Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks to be executed concurrently, without blocking the main execution thread. It enables efficient utilization of system resources by allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for slower operations, such as **network requests** or file **I/O**, to complete. This can greatly improve the **responsiveness** and **scalability** of applications, as it avoids unnecessary waiting times and allows for better utilization of computing resources. 😊✨🚀.

### API Gateway 🔐
This will be a passage to other services, meaning all other services will pass through here when perfoming a task. This will work by clients making an API request (can be for `odering`, `product`, or `authenticating`) which will first get processed by the API gateway and only then the request will be sent to it's rightful request method.

### Role-based Authentication 🪪
This part will be checked at the `Order Api` service which will connect (by making a request) to the `Authentication Api` in order to get the rightful role permissions.

### Order API 💸
The `order api` is where the client will be able to make/place an order. The api will connect (by making a request) with the `product api` in order to get the available products.

### Cahching 🦾
**Caching** is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area (cache) to reduce the time and resources needed to retrieve that data. In a .NET 8 microservice application, caching can significantly improve **performance** and **scalability** by reducing the load on the `database` and other services.

### Rate Limit ⏱️
Is a technique used to **control** the number of requests a client can make to a service within a specified time period. This helps protect the service from being overwhelmed by too many requests, either `accidentally` or `maliciously`.

## Database
I will create a single database where the application will gather data from. I will be using SQL Server.
